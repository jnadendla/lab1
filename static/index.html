    <ol>
        <li><h5>Internship at Keysight/Agilent Technologies</h5>
            I interned at Keysight/Agilent Technologies primarily working on usability
            improvements to their VSA product.  I implemented a customizable toolbar as well
            as a drag and drop recall functionality.  I also created a instrument connection
            system based on creating a file with the IP address of the instrument to connect
            to.
        </li>
        <li><h5>Second Internship at Keysight Technologies</h5>
            During my second internship I worked on a graphics oriented UI that displayes an
            multi-emitter scenario in a 3D space.
        </li>
        <li><h5>Security Projects From Classes</h5>
            During an intro security class I implemented numerous hacks on the C framework,
            including a buffer overflow, integer overflow, and virtual table overflow.
